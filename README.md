**ReqSense** is a requirement management application built using ASP.NET Core and Angular frameworks. The system is created with Clean architecture and Google Gemini LLM integration.

Its main idea is to help stakeholders determine requirements for their product and reduce time required to negotiate requirements with the business analyst and project manager. The stakeholder can enter a requirement and get instant follow-up questions to improve it and make the requirement more detailed and complete. This way, the stakeholder can answer questions regarding product functionality before they potentially arise.

The idea, design and implementation is done by me.



The application has little functionality and can be considered an MVP.

Potential improvements include: taking into account all project requirements to create better questions, finding inconsistency between requirements.

Below you can explore a quick demo.
